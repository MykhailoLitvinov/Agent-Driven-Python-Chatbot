## üí¨ Sample Interactions

```bash
> How do I secure my email account?
ü§ñ (Auto-selected Sentinel): 
**Immediate Action**: Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your email account right now.

**Simple Explanation**: 2FA adds a second layer of security that makes it nearly impossible for hackers to access your account, even if they have your password...

> I want to save $500 per month
ü§ñ (Auto-selected FinGuide):
**Quick Assessment**: Great goal! $500/month is $6,000 annually - a solid foundation for financial security.

**Immediate Action**: Open a separate high-yield savings account today to keep this money separate from spending funds...

> @EduBot explain how neural networks work
ü§ñ (Directly called EduBot):
**Simple Summary**: Neural networks are computer systems that learn patterns by mimicking how brain neurons connect and communicate.

**Build Understanding**: Think of it like teaching a child to recognize cats in photos. You show thousands of cat pictures...
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration System

The chatbot uses a sophisticated YAML-based configuration system with two types of configs:

### Interactive Agent Configs (`/config/interactive/`)
Each user-facing agent has its own configuration:

```yaml
name: FinGuide
alias: "@FinGuide"
description: Personal financial advisor focused on practical budgeting and investment guidance
temperature: 0.3
model: gpt-4o-mini
max_tokens: 1000
system_prompt: |
  You are FinGuide, a financial advisor who helps people make smart money decisions.
  
  ## Your Role
  Provide practical, easy-to-follow financial advice...
```

### System Configs (`/config/system/`)
Internal system components are also configurable:

```yaml
# agent_selector.yaml - Controls automatic agent selection
name: AgentSelector
model: gpt-4o-mini
temperature: 0.1
max_tokens: 50
system_prompt: |
  You are an expert at matching user queries to the most appropriate AI assistant...

# summarizer.yaml - Controls conversation summarization  
name: Summarizer
model: gpt-4o-mini
temperature: 0.2
max_tokens: 300
system_prompt: |
  You are an expert conversation summarizer who creates concise, accurate summaries...
```

## üß™ Testing

The project includes comprehensive test coverage with 116+ unit tests:

```bash
# Install testing dependencies
pip install -r test_requirements.txt

# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test modules
pytest tests/test_agents.py -v
pytest tests/test_llm_client.py -v

```

### Test Categories
- **Agent Management**: Tests for LLM-based agent selection and configuration loading
- **LLM Integration**: Tests for OpenAI API calls with JSON schema responses
- **Memory Management**: Tests for conversation context and summarization
- **Core Functionality**: Tests for chatbot workflows and error handling
- **Logging System**: Tests for conversation logging and metrics

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights

### LLM-Powered Agent Selection
- Uses OpenAI's structured output with JSON schema for reliable agent routing
- Fallback to keyword-based selection if LLM selection fails
- Configurable selection criteria and prompts

### Intelligent Context Management
- Maintains recent conversation history with configurable memory limits
- Automatic conversation summarization when memory limit is reached
- JSON-structured summaries for consistent format

### Configuration-Driven Design
- All agents and system components use YAML configuration files
- Hot-swappable prompts and parameters without code changes
- Separation of interactive (user-facing) and system configurations

### Robust Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks for LLM failures
- Comprehensive logging with performance metrics
- Exception handling with user-friendly error messages

---

## üìà Metrics & Logging

All conversations, performance metrics, and system events are logged in the `logs/` directory:

- **Conversation Logs**: Complete chat history with timestamps
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, agent selection decisions, memory usage
- **Error Tracking**: LLM failures, configuration issues, system errors
- **Agent Analytics**: Usage patterns, selection accuracy, response quality

Log files are rotated daily and include structured data for analysis.

---

## üöÄ Advanced Usage

### Environment Variables
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
MAX_MEMORY_MESSAGES=10  # Override default memory limit
```

### Custom Agent Development
1. Create a new YAML config in `/config/interactive/`
2. Define the agent's expertise, prompts, and parameters
3. Add the agent name to the `AgentName` enum in `src/agents.py`
4. The system will automatically load and use the new agent

### Configuration Customization
- Modify agent personalities by editing system prompts
- Adjust response styles by changing temperature and max_tokens
- Customize agent selection behavior via `agent_selector.yaml`
- Fine-tune summarization with `summarizer.yaml` parameters
